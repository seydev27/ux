## INVENTORY:


## 🗣️ User Interview Summary

**Reqs:** Understand how frequent users of food delivery apps make decisions, and what factors build or erode trust.  
**Results:** Identified key motivators (speed, clarity, and reliability), along with recurring frustrations around delivery timing, unclear menus, and inconsistent driver behavior.

---

## 👣 Field Study Notes

**Reqs:** Observe restaurant-side order handling and driver pickup behavior to surface real-world friction points.  
**Results:** Found critical inefficiencies in how orders are queued, handed off, and tracked — especially during peak hours.

---

## 🧪 Usability Test Script

**Reqs:** Assess ease-of-use for prototype order flows and test user expectations around customization and confirmation.  
**Results:** Surface-level task success was high, but test revealed subtle barriers to trust (e.g., lack of clarity about payment timing and delivery visibility).

---

## 🧠 Affinity Mapping

**Reqs:** Synthesize data from interviews and field notes to identify themes, gaps, and priority insights.  
**Results:** Clustered findings around key needs: predictability, transparency, and real-time communication — guiding early product concept direction.

---

## 📊 Final Insight Summary

**Reqs:** Deliver a stakeholder-ready artifact summarizing top research findings and recommendations.  
**Results:** Highlighted opportunity to differentiate with role-specific onboarding, embedded feedback loops, and lightweight status updates between order and delivery.
