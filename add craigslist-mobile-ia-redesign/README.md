# 🧭 CRAIGSLIST MOBILE – IA REDESIGN CASE STUDY

This project focused on redesigning the mobile information architecture (IA) for Craigslist to improve task findability and reduce user friction. The team restructured the IA around user actions instead of categories, resulting in improved task completion rates and fewer navigation errors. Completed as part of a UC Berkeley UX course in Information Architecture.

## 📌 Reqs  
- Identify high-value user tasks and related business goals  
- Evaluate the existing IA and perform a gap analysis  
- Conduct card sorting and tree testing to validate new structures  
- Propose a revised sitemap and navigation system  
- Deliver low-fidelity wireframes based on updated IA

## 📂 Key Artifacts  
📊 Task research and business context summary  
📈 Tree test results (baseline and revised IA)  
🧠 Card sort data and abstract IA  
🗺️ Site map drafts and navigation flows  
📋 Label evaluation spreadsheet  
📐 Lo-fi wireframes (Balsamiq)  

## 🛠 Tools & Tech

## 💡 Why It Mattered  
The existing Craigslist mobile experience was category-heavy and difficult to navigate on small screens. By restructuring the IA around actions—rather than nested categories—the team significantly improved success rates, reduced misclicks, and helped users move from browsing to completing key tasks more efficiently.
