# 🧭 Craigslist Mobile – IA Redesign

🔗 **See it live:** [Full Case Study on UXGO](https://uxgo.io/p/loopsoft)

Team redesign of the information architecture (IA) for Craigslist's mobile app to improve navigation and reduce friction on small screens. 
This UC Berkeley UX project achieved the key insight through mental model resarch — to focus on restructuring category depth by shifting to an action-based model — helping users complete high-value tasks faster.

## 📌 Requirements

- 📱 Improve usability on mobile devices  
- 🔍 Align IA with users’ mental models  
- 🧭 Reduce cognitive load from deep categories  
- 🎯 Surface high-value, revenue-generating tasks more efficiently  
- 👥 Support both “seekers” and “doers” within Craigslist’s community model  

---

## 📐 Process

1. **Gap Analysis** – Identified mismatches between tasks and IA  
2. **Card Sorting** – 18 sessions (in-person + remote)  
3. **Tree Testing** – Baseline and follow-up validation  
4. **Abstract IA** – Synthesized from card sort results  
5. **Wireframes** – Lo-fi mobile UI mockups

## ✅ Results

- 🔼 Direct success rate improved by 35–50%  
- 🔽 Skips dropped by 40% in deep categories  
- 💡 “Action-first” IA outperformed category-first in user tests  
- 🧠 Users reached desired outcomes in fewer steps  
- 📊 Tree test data showed increased clarity and confidence in navigation
