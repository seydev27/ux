ðŸ”— **See it:** [Product Video on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/your-link-here)

This project began as a real product: a mobile app designed and launched in Hawaiâ€˜i to help vacation rental owners share arrival and in-stay information with guests. After securing initial clients in Lahaina, I later revisited the product using formal UX methodology as part of my certification through UC Berkeley Extension.
